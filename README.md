# FERN NYC: Flood Evaluation and Resilience in New York City (FERN): A Socioeconomic Perspective

## Introduction
### 1.1 Background

New York City (NYC) has witnessed a marked increase in extreme weather events, leading to severe flooding and associated challenges. The record-breaking rainfall at JFK Airport on September 29, 2023, and the devastating impacts of Hurricane Sandy (2012) and Hurricane Ida (2021) underscore the urgent need for enhanced flood resilience, particularly as the city grapples with a dense and growing population. The National Weather Service’s designation of September 2023 as the rainiest in NYC’s last 140 years further highlights this trend.

### 1.2 Motivation

Improving flood resilience is crucial for NYC, given its vulnerability and the increasing frequency of extreme weather events. This research aims to develop a robust metric for assessing flood resilience in NYC, identifying areas with low resilience but high future flood risk. By integrating socioeconomic factors and demographic data, the study will provide insights into the disparate impacts of flooding across communities, contributing to equitable and effective flood mitigation strategies.

Based on the trajectory of increasing extreme weather events in New York City, it is plausible to predict that the city will experience more frequent and severe flooding incidents in the coming years. As the coastal population continues to grow, areas with low resilience and high vulnerability to flooding will be at greater risk, emphasizing the urgent need for targeted flood mitigation and resilience-building efforts. The integration of socioeconomic factors into flood resilience metrics will play a critical role in these endeavors, helping to uncover disparities in flood impacts across different communities and ensuring that mitigation strategies are equitable and effective. There will likely be a significant push towards improving infrastructure, enhancing emergency preparedness, and implementing sustainable urban planning practices to mitigate flood risks. This increased focus on flood resilience will not only protect vulnerable populations but also contribute to the overall sustainability and livability of New York City. The research and data-driven approaches developed in this study are expected to serve as valuable resources for city planners, policymakers, and emergency management officials, guiding informed decision-making and fostering a more resilient urban environment.
